## Responsiveness Units

### `em`
- The `em` unit is a relative unit that is based on the font size of the parent element.
- Use `em` for elements whose size should be relative to the font size of their parent container.

### `px`
- The `px` unit is an absolute unit that represents a single pixel on the screen.
- Use `px` for elements that need to have a fixed size regardless of the parent container or font size.

### `rem`
- The `rem` unit is a relative unit that is based on the root element's font size (usually set to the `<html>` element).
- Use `rem` for elements that need to be relative to the root font size, allowing for easy global adjustments.
